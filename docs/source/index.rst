Project MILESTONE (short overview)
===================================

MILESTONE (Microseismicity Illuminates Subduction Zone Processes) is an ERC Starting Grant project currently carried out at the Institute of Geophysics, CAS, Prague.


1. Introduction: Subduction Zones and Seismicity
--------

- `Background seismicity and large events`_

.. _Background seismicity and large events: https://milestone-web.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Kap1.html

- Different types of seismicity
- Rates and Mc
- What information is contained?

2. Project Goals
--------

- Novel and more complete seismicity catalogs for different subduction zones through the application of ML-based picking and association approaches
- 



3. Project Structure
--------

Project MILESTONE is composed of five work packages, presented in the following:

- WP1:
